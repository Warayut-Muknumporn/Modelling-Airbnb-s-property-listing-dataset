Airbnb Property Price Prediction Model

# Project Description
Airbnb hosts millions of listings on their website. Sometimes it is difficult to decide what range of nightly price to set for your property but also what features and descriptions to use for the most success. On the flip side, as a consumer, it can be difficult to decipher what properties are listed at a fair price in comparison to the history of previous listing prices. Therefore, it is useful to know which features/traits are most influential for the price per night for both hosting/staying.
Using web-scraped data on Airbnb of 1000 properties, generate simple regression models and a neural network to best predict the price per night based on quantitative features that Airbnb provides.
